<h3 align="center">Arch Bootc / Hyprland / HyprYou</h3>


# What's Nirconium?
A custom arch-bootc image built for container usage/development and day-to-day usage, making use of [Hyprland](https://hypr.land) and [HyprYou](https://github.com/koeqaife/hyprland-material-you) to provide a usable OOTB TWM experience without sacrificing on looks.

# How can I use this?
WIP.

# Can I customize this?
Absolutely! Although we've worked to provide good defaults OOTB, you can still customize the looks to your liking.

# Features


- Linux/Arch Bootc


- Ease of use whether you're a terminal warrior or GUI master


- Hyprland, a tiling window manager that doesnt sacrifice on looks


- HyprYou, a shell for Hyprland that uses the [Material 3 Design](m3.material.io) language whereever possible


- CachyOS Kernel with cpu optimizations (for V3+ cpus) (Bore scheduler)


- Flatpak/AppImage support OOTB with Bazaar/Warehouse (software store, flatpak manager) and Gear Lever (AppImage manager)


# Notice
This OS is only compatible and intended for desktop PCs with AMD/Intel graphics, and has optimizations for [V3 cpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels). NVIDIA graphics are unsupported by this image and will never be supported directly, a custom image fork of this OS would be needed to install NVIDIA graphics drivers as we have no intention whatsoever to provide an image with such drivers.
