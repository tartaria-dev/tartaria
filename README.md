# What's Nirconium?
A custom arch-bootc image built for container usage/development and day-to-day usage, making use of [Hyprland](https://hypr.land) and [HyprYou](https://github.com/koeqaife/hyprland-material-you) to provide a usable OOTB TWM experience without sacrificing on looks.


# How can I use this?
At the moment, only rebasing is supported. Rebasing has been highly untested, however, so please report any issues rebasing.
Use the following command on any Fedora or Fedora based system that supports `bootc`:
```
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/nirconium-dev/nirconium
```
...and you'll be on your (jolly) way!


# Can I customize this?
Absolutely! Although we've worked to provide good defaults OOTB, you can still customize the looks to your liking.


# Features

- Based on CachyOS/Arch with bootc support

- Hyprland, a tiling window manager that doesnt sacrifice on looks

- HyprYou, a customizable shell for Hyprland that uses the [Material 3 Design](m3.material.io) language whereever possible

My pure, unadulterated hatred for a specific wax baby inspired the name. God, I hate that baby.
